# Intro :
An app that helps students living on a budget plan, manage, and keep track of monthly budgets. Users will specify deposits, income, planned payments and savings, and the app will track and create monthly reports for budget handling. 

# Tech goals:
- Django framework as backend, React.js for frontend, Django built in SQLite as database. 
- Write testings for both backend and frontend, using Selenium for client-side testing. 
- Application should be packaged into Docker, and finally deployed using Heroku.
